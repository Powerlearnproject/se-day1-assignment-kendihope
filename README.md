#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the disciplined apporoach to designing,developing,testing, deploying and maintaining software systems.
Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The development of high level programming languages which made programming more accessible, abstracting complex machine code into human readable syntax which allowed software development to scale and become more efficient.
2. Introduction of structured programming which emphasized clear logical control structures and modular design. This improved code readability, maintanability and reduced errors.
3. The rise of agile methodologies which introduced iterative developments, regular feedback and flexibility in response to changing requirements. This focused on collaboration, customer satisfaction and the ability to adapt quickly.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning- we define the project's goals, scope and feasiblity, a project plan with timelines,resources and risk assessment is the outcome in this stage.
2. Requirement analysis- we gather and document the software requirements that guides the software development.
3.Design- we create the architecture and design for the software system( data flow diagrams and database designs)
4.Implementation- we write the actual code based on the design and have a functioning software system.
5. Testing- we test and veerify that the software is working as intended and it is bug- free.
6.Deployment- this is where we release the software to users in a live environment.
7. Maintenance- we fix bugs, update and maintain the software over time to ensure software functionality and relevance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology follows a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next one begins. This rigid structure makes it easier to plan and estimate costs upfront, but limits flexibility and adaptability while project is underway. A scenario where waterfall methodology is where the project scope and requirements are clearly defined such as construction projects.
Agile methodology is iterative and incremental, allowing for continous feedback and adaptation throughout the project lifecycle. this promotes collaboration among cross-functional teams focusing on delivering small, functional increments of the product in short cycles which enables teams to respond quickly to changesand incorporate stakeholder feedback at various development stages. A scenario where agile methodology would be appropriate is in a fast-paced environment where requirements change frequently such as marketing campaigns or product design

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developers focus on the technical aspects of building a software, design and development, testing and debugging, collaboration with other team members, maintainance and updates for softwares and documentation of the code  and development processes.
A Quality Assurance Engineer focuses on ensuring the quality and functionality of the product. They test the software to ensure it meets the standards and is free of defects, identify issues and maintain detailed records of test cases results and defect reports.
Project managers focus on overseeing the project from a strategic perspective ensuring that it is completed on time and within the budget. They are responsible for defining project scopes, objectives and deliverables, identify potential risks to the project and develop strategies to mitigate them.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs enhance productivity by streamlining the coding process by integrating various development tools into a single platform.They provide built-in error checking and debugging capabilities which help developers identify and fix issues early in the development cycle. Using a common IDE within a development team promotes standardization in coding practises. an example of IDE is Visual studio Code and Eclipse
VCSs are essential for managing changes to code overtime. They allow developers to track revision, revert to previous versions and maintain a history of changes which is vital for understanding the evolution of a project. They provide a backup for the project through one central repository. An example of a VCS is GIT and Mercurial 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Requirement volatility- frequent changes in a project can lead to confusion and delays making it difficult for developers to stay aligned with project goals. Implementing agile methodologies that emphasize iterative development and stakeholder feedback allows teams to adapt to changes more fluidly.
2. Limited budgets and resources- Tight budgets and limited resources can strain project timelines and quality leading to burnout among team members. Prioritizing effective project management practises such as realistic budgeting and resource allocation, setting achievable goals and expectations reducing likelihood of resource constraints.
3. Unclear software requirements- Ambigous or poorly defined requirements cam lead to wasted effort and project delays. Establishing a thorough requirement-gathering process that involves all stakeholders. Clear documentation and regular reviews can help ensure that everyone understands the project scope and objectives onset.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing involves verifying the functionality of individual components or modules of a software system. It identifies and fixes defects in the early stages of development, ensures that each unit of code performs as expected, facilitates code refactoring and changes and provides documentation about the tested units. this reduces the cost and time used to fix the defects in the later stages of development.
2. Integration testing is where individual components are combined and tested as a group. The main objectives are verifying that the interfaces between the components work as expected, identifying issues that arise from the interaction of multiple components, ensuring that the system meets its specified requirements and validating the overall architecture and design of the system. This is crucial for identifying issues that may not be apparent during unit testing.
3. System testing is a comprehensive testing process that evaluates the entire system against its specified requirements. The main objectives are validating that the system meets its functional and non-functional requirements, identifying sysytem-level issues, ensuring that the system works correctly in its intended environment, providing confidence that the system is ready for deployment.
4. Acceptance testing is the final stage where the system is evaluated to determine if it meets the customer's requirements and is ready for deployment. The main objectives are validating that the system meets the customers specified requirements, ensuring that the system is usable and meets the end-user's needs, providing a final opportunity to identify and fix any remaining issues.obtaining customer approval and acceptance of the system.  

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practise of designing and refining inputs to maximize outputs generated by AI
This process is critical in enhancing the interaction between users and AI systems ensuring that generated responses are relevant and accurate

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Summary in physics- vague prompt
Can you provide a summary on nuclear physis. this is the improved prompt, it will make the LLM give me a clear and concise answer as to what nuclear physis is compared to the first prompt.
